## 🧠 Abstract

The proliferation of AI-generated anime images presents significant challenges for online platforms, artists, and consumers. In this paper, we address the problem of distinguishing between **human-created** and **AI-generated** anime images using deep learning techniques.

We present a novel approach that enhances the **MobileNetV2** architecture with **channel attention mechanisms** and **optimized test-time augmentation**.

- **Dataset**: 5,700 balanced images  
  - 2,850 human-created  
  - 2,850 AI-generated  
- **Accuracy**: **97.28%**
- **Architecture**: Lightweight, attention-augmented MobileNetV2
- **Strengths**:
  - Captures subtle artistic differences
  - Resource-efficient; suitable for deployment
  - Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods

Our results show that strategic architectural enhancements and inference-time techniques can significantly improve performance **without increasing model complexity**. This contributes to the growing field of AI-generated content detection and provides tools for **protecting human artistic expression**.

## 📝 Notes

- No detailed `README.md` provided — because you can just read the full paper.
- But hey, thanks for checking this out. ❤️
- Uploading to arXiv is a hassle, I will try that in the near future
- Plus I can't find a free anonymous filehoster to host my 7.5GB dataset... so you gotta wait on that (Zenodo doesn't recognize my ORCID, Terminal.LC is closed, I am finding more options)
